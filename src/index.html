        <h2 class="chapter pink">CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
        <p>
            Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
            the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
            into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
            conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
            <span class="text">“without pictures or conversations?”</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for
            the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
            pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
            getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
            with pink eyes ran close by her.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
            so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
            dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over
            afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at
            this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
            Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked
            at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
            flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with
            either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning
            with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately
            was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
            hedge.
